##### scrapy 和 selenium 结合

主要就 selenium 返回浏览器解析后的数据给 scrapy

或者我们使用 splash 也是一样的

下面的例子中 我们是写在中间件中

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# Define here the models for your spider middleware
#
# See documentation in:
# https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spider-middleware.html

from scrapy import signals
from selenium import webdriver
from scrapy.http import HtmlResponse

        input.send_keys('python')
        submit.click()
        time.sleep(4)
        body  = self.browser.page_source
        return HtmlResponse(request.url,status=200,body=body,headers=request.headers,encoding='utf-8')
